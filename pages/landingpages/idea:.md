idea:
  Barbershop ad TV network
    - create a QR code to interact with the page (https://github.com/nayuki/QR-Code-generator/tree/master/typescript-javascript)
  React vs NextJS/React
    - log-in to the web-app via the QR code.
    - tie user info together post login
      - tracking pixel
    - content is created via client-side rendering
    - load images in db (firestore?)
      - create analytics to track usage over time
        - number of ads run
        - customer visit per month
        - customer demographic
    - Hardware: raspberry pi
    - Payments gateway: Strie (3.8%), v2 Paypal
    - customer onboarding (google local, facebook local)
    - Link out to experts to build ads (discovery fee option)
